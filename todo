fix ActiveCode portions
what is this pythonds stuff?
do we need summary, discussion?
add better introductions throughout
consider if we want a glossary, and if so write it out
move code blocks to {% include %} tags, for linting, testability etc
fix math formatting, e.g. http://localhost:4000/analysis/an-anagram-detection-example.html
could/should we have sub sub sections? or just break sections into smaller chenks?
ensure curly quotes everywhere
figure out if figures should be linked

branding

is there an easier way to lint/pep8-ify this stuff?

do full pass through editing for each section:
    convert activecode portions
    add a better introduction
    move key terms to glossary, if any
    move large code blocks out into include tags
    improve sections
    remove listing numbers
    make sure all Python is idiomatic

trees
    use tuples (or named tuples in list-of-lists representation?)
    more compact introduction incorporating intro, examples and definitions
