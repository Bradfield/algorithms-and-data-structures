fix ActiveCode portions (search for "ActiveCode")
what is this pythonds stuff?
do we need summary, discussion?
move code blocks either to {% include %} tags or literate python, for linting, testability etc
break into more logical chunks or just break sections into smaller chenks?
remove unused figures
branding
line numbers for code samples?

is there an easier way to lint/pep8-ify this stuff?

do full pass through editing for each section:
    add better instructions
    convert activecode portions
    add a better introduction
    move large code blocks out into include tags
    improve sections
    remove listing numbers
    make sure all Python is idiomatic
    fix math formatting
    ensure curly quotes everywhere

trees
    use tuples (or named tuples in list-of-lists representation?)
    more compact introduction incorporating intro, examples and definitions

recursion
    maybe add more/better examples

sorting-searching
    split into searching, maps and sorting
    find the best possible visualizations of sorts
    add a rationale
