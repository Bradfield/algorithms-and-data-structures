fix ActiveCode portions
what is this pythonds stuff?
do we need summary, discussion?
add better introductions throughout
consider if we want a glossary, and if so write it out
move code blocks either to {% include %} tags or literate python, for linting, testability etc
break into more logical chunks or just break sections into smaller chenks?

is there an easier way to lint/pep8-ify this stuff?

do full pass through editing for each section:
    convert activecode portions
    add a better introduction
    move key terms to glossary, if any
    move large code blocks out into include tags
    improve sections
    remove listing numbers
    make sure all Python is idiomatic
    fix math formatting
    ensure curly quotes everywhere

trees
    use tuples (or named tuples in list-of-lists representation?)
    more compact introduction incorporating intro, examples and definitions
