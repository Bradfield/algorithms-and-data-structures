Algorithms and Data Structures with Python
===

This book is a practical—and we hope, entertaining—introduction to some
of the most important data structures and algorithms in computer
science.

We have written the examples in this book in idiomatic Python to help
convey the *usefulness* of these data structures and algorithms, both
directly and as models for analogous work that you will do.

Many software engineers are skeptical that this subject matter is
useful. Our best explanation for such skepticism is that those engineers
never encountered these topics in a way that was encouraged deep
understanding. Perhaps they were [unfortunate
enough](http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education) to participate in
a computer science program that encouraged rote memorization, or
subjected themselves to such an experience for the sake of succeeding at
technical interviews. Or perhaps they became adequate programmers
without having encountered the content at all, and presume that they
have reached the limits of their capabilities.

Whatever the case, we’re confident that the usefulness of studying
algorithms and data structures increases proportionally to the depth at
which you understand it—a depth that comes through a combination of
study and application. Those who understand trees in depth are more
likely to identify tree shapes in their own data, and have the
confidence to apply a traversal algorithm appropriately. Those who count
Big-O analysis as a tool in their toolkits not only have a better
vocabulary for comparing alternative strategies, they are also more
cognizant overall of the trade offs we implicitly make every day. Those
who see recursion everywhere see recursion everywhere :)

One trade off that *we* have made is to sacrifice breadth for the sake
of depth. We cover fewer data structures and algorithms than a typical
introductory text may cover, in order to focus more on what we consider
to be important. For instance we do not cover sorting algorithms at all,
and instead spend more time walking you through interesting applications
of tree and graph traversal algorithms. For this reason, we hope that
you work through the examples slowly, with a REPL or text editor open,
verifying that you absorb and appreciate the content at the depth
required to appreciate its usefulness for decades to come.

Assumed Knowledge
---

This book assumes intermediate knowledge of Python. If you encounter any
unfamiliar Python usage, we encourage you to use [Learn Python the Hard
Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) or [Dive into
Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html), both of which are
excellent and freely available online.
