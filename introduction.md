Algorithms and Data Structures with Python
===

This book is a practical—and we hope, entertaining—introduction to some
of the most important data structures and algorithms in computer
science.

Throughout, we provide implementations and examples in idiomatic Python,
to help convey the *usefulness* of these data structures and algorithms,
both directly and as models for analogous or derivative work that you
do.

Many practicing software engineers are skeptical that data structures
and algorithms are as useful as we suggest. Our best explanation for
this skepticism is that they never encountered the content in a way that
was encouraged deep understanding. Perhaps they were [unfortunate
enough](http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education) to study the
content in a computer science program that encouraged rote memorization,
or subjected themselves to such an experience for the sake of passing
technical interviews. Or perhaps they became adequate programmers
without having encountered the content at all, and doubt that there may
be more to learn than what they already know.

Whatever the case may be, we’re confident that the usefulness of this
content increases proportionally to the depth at which you understand
it—a depth that comes through a combination of study and application.
Those who understand trees in depth are more likely to identify tree
shapes in their own data, and have the confidence to apply a traversal
algorithm with predictable results. Those who have Big-O analysis as a
tool in their toolkits are not only better at discussing alternatives
and deciding between trade offs, they are overall more cognizant of the
trade offs that we implicitly make as software engineers every day.
Those who see recursion everywhere see recursion everywhere :)

One trade off that *we* have made is to sacrifice breadth for the sake
of depth. We cover fewer data structures and algorithms than a typical
introductory text may cover, so that we can focus more on those that we
consider to be more fundamental. For instance we do not cover sorting
algorithms at all, and instead spend more time walking you through
interesting applications of tree and graph traversal algorithms. For
this reason, we hope that you work through the examples slowly, with a
REPL or text editor open, verifying that you absorb and appreciate the
content at the depth required to appreciate its usefulness for decades
to come.

Assumed Knowledge
---

This book assumes intermediate knowledge of Python. If you encounter any
unfamiliar Python usage, we encourage you to use [Learn Python the Hard
Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) or [Dive into
Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html), both of which are
excellent and freely available online.
