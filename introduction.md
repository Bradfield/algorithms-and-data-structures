Algorithms and Data Structures with Python
===

This book is a practical—and we hope, entertaining—introduction to some
of the most important data structures and algorithms in computer
science.

We have written the examples in this book in idiomatic Python to help
convey the *usefulness* of these data structures and algorithms, both
directly and as models for analogous work that you will do.

Many software engineers are skeptical that this subject matter is
useful. Our best explanation for such skepticism is that those engineers
never encountered these topics in a way that was encouraged deep
understanding. Perhaps they were [unfortunate
enough](http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education) to participate in
a computer science program that encouraged rote memorization, or
subjected themselves to such an experience for the sake of succeeding at
technical interviews. Or perhaps they became adequate programmers
without having encountered the content at all, and presume that they
have reached the limits of their capabilities.

Whatever the case, we’re confident that the usefulness of algorithms and
data structures is proportional to the depth at which you understand it.
Those who understand trees in depth are more likely to identify tree
shapes in their own data, unlocking superior solutions to their
problems. Those who count Big-O analysis as a tool in their toolkits not
only have a better vocabulary for comparing alternative strategies, they
are also more cognizant overall of the trade offs we implicitly make
every day. Those who see recursion everywhere see recursion everywhere
:)

One trade off that *we* have made is to sacrifice breadth for the sake
of depth. We cover fewer data structures and algorithms than a typical
introductory text may cover, in order to focus more on what we consider
to be important. For instance we do not cover sorting algorithms at all—
a topic that rarely arises in practice— and instead spend more time
walking you through interesting applications of tree and graph traversal
algorithms. For this reason, we hope that you work through the examples
slowly, with a REPL or text editor open, verifying that you absorb and
appreciate the content at the depth required to appreciate its
usefulness for decades to come.
