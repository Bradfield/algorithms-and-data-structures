Summary of Map ADT Implementations
==================================

Over the past two chapters we have looked at several data structures
that can be used to implement the map abstract data type. A binary
Search on a list, a hash table, a binary search tree, and a balanced
binary search tree. To conclude this section, letâ€™s summarize the
performance of each data structure for the key operations defined by the
map ADT (see Table 1 &lt;tab\_compare&gt;).
