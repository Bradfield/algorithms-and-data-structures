The `TreeNode` class provides many helper functions that make the work
done in the `BinarySearchTree` class methods much easier. The
constructor for a `TreeNode`, along with these helper functions, is
shown below. As you can see, many
of these helper functions help to classify a node according to its own
position as a child, (left or right) and the kind of children the node
has. The `TreeNode` class will also explicitly keep track of the parent
as an attribute of each node. You will see why this is important when we
discuss the implementation for the `del` operator.

Another interesting aspect of the implementation of `TreeNode` below is
that we use Pythonâ€™s optional parameters. Optional parameters make it
easy for us to create a `TreeNode` under several different
circumstances. Sometimes we will want to construct a new `TreeNode` that
already has both a `parent` and a `child`. With an existing parent and
child, we can pass parent and child as parameters. At other times we
will just create a `TreeNode` with the key value pair, and we will not
pass any parameters for `parent` or `child`. In this case, the default
values of the optional parameters are used.

We need to look at one last interface method for the binary search tree.
Suppose that we would like to simply iterate over all the keys in the
tree in order. You already know how to traverse a
binary tree in order, using the `inorder` traversal algorithm. However,
writing an iterator requires a bit more work, since an iterator should
return only one node each time the iterator is called.

Python provides us with a very powerful function to use when creating an
iterator. The function is called `yield`. `yield` is similar to `return`
in that it returns a value to the caller. However, `yield` also takes
the additional step of freezing the state of the function so that the
next time the function is called it continues executing from the exact
point it left off earlier. Functions that create objects that can be
iterated are called generator functions.

The code for an `inorder` iterator of a binary tree is shown below. Look
at this code carefully; at first glance you might think that the code is
not recursive. However, remember that `__iter__` overrides the `for x
in` operation for iteration, so it really is recursive! Because it is
recursive over `TreeNode` instances the `__iter__` method is defined in
the `TreeNode` class.

Now that we have the `BinarySearchTree` shell and the `TreeNode` it is
time to write the `put` method that will allow us to build our binary
search tree. The `put` method is a method of the `BinarySearchTree`
class. This method will check to see if the tree already has a root. If
there is not a root then `put` will create a new `TreeNode` and install
it as the root of the tree. If a root node is already in place then
`put` calls the private, recursive, helper function `_put` to search the
tree according to the following algorithm:

-   Starting at the root of the tree, search the binary tree comparing
    the new key to the key in the current node. If the new key is less
    than the current node, search the left subtree. If the new key is
    greater than the current node, search the right subtree.
-   When there is no left (or right) child to search, we have found the
    position in the tree where the new node should be installed.
-   To add a node to the tree, create a new `TreeNode` object and insert
    the object at the point discovered in the previous step.

The code below shows the Python code for inserting a new
node in the tree. The `_put` function is written recursively following
the steps outlined above. Notice that when a new child is inserted into
the tree, the `node` is passed to the new tree as the parent.

One important problem with our implementation of insert is that
duplicate keys are not handled properly. As our tree is implemented a
duplicate key will create a new node with the same key value in the
right subtree of the node having the original key. The result of this is
that the node with the new key will never be found during a search. A
better way to handle the insertion of a duplicate key is for the value
associated with the new key to replace the old value. We leave fixing
this bug as an exercise for you.

With the `put` method defined, we can easily overload the `[]`

The diagram below illustrates the process for inserting a new
node into a binary search tree. The lightly shaded nodes indicate the
nodes that were visited during the insertion process.

![Inserting a node with key = 19](figures/binary-search-tree-put.png)

Once the tree is constructed, the next task is to implement the
retrieval of a value for a given key. The `get` method is even easier
than the `put` method because it simply searches the tree recursively
until it gets to a non-matching leaf node or finds a matching key. When
a matching key is found, the value stored in the val of the node is
returned.

The code below shows the code for `get`, `_get` and
`__getitem__`. The search code in the `_get` method uses the same logic
for choosing the left or right child as the `_put` method. Notice that
the `_get` method returns a `TreeNode` to `get`, this allows `_get` to
be used as a flexible helper method for other `BinarySearchTree` methods
that may need to make use of other data from the `TreeNode` besides the
val.

By implementing the `__getitem__` method we can write a Python statement
that looks just like we are accessing a dictionary, when in fact we are
using a binary search tree, for example `z = my_zip_tree['Fargo']`. As you
can see, all the `__getitem__` method does is call `get`.

Using `get`, we can implement the `in` operation by writing a
`__contains__` method for the `BinarySearchTree`. The `__contains__`
method will simply call `get` and return `True` if `get` returns a

shown below.

binary search tree, the deletion of a key (see below). The first task is
to find the node to delete by searching the tree. If the tree has more
than one node we search using the `_get` method to find the `TreeNode`
that needs to be removed. If the tree only has a single node, that means
we are removing the root of the tree, but we still must check to make
sure the key of the root matches the key that is to be deleted. In
either case if the key is not found the `del` operator raises an error.

case is shown below.

![Deleting Node 16, a Node without
Children](figures/binary-search-tree-delete-1.png)

The second case is only slightly more complicated (see below). If a node
has only a single child, then we can simply promote the child to take
the place of its parent. The code for this case is shown in the next
code sample. As you look at this code you will see that there are six
cases to consider. Since the cases are symmetric with respect to either
having a left or right child we will just discuss the case where the
current node has a left child. The decision proceeds as follows:

1.  If the current node is a left child then we only need to update the
    parent reference of the left child to point to the parent of the
    current node, and then update the left child reference of the parent
    to point to the current nodeâ€™s left child.
2.  If the current node is a right child then we only need to update the
    parent reference of the right child to point to the parent of the
    current node, and then update the right child reference of the
    parent to point to the current nodeâ€™s right child.
3.  If the current node has no parent, it must be the root. In this case
    we will just replace the `key`, `val`, `left`, and
    `right` data by calling the `replace_node_data` method on
    the root.

Code for this decision process may look like:

The third case is the most difficult case to handle (see below). If a
node has two children, then it is unlikely that we can simply promote
one of them to take the nodeâ€™s place. We can, however, search the tree
for a node that can be used to replace the one scheduled for deletion.
What we need is a node that will preserve the binary search tree
relationships for both of the existing left and right subtrees. The node
that will do this is the node that has the next-largest key in the tree.
We call this node the **successor**, and we will look at a way to find
the successor shortly. The successor is guaranteed to have no more than
one child, so we know how to remove it using the two cases for deletion
that we have already implemented. Once the successor has been removed,
we simply put it in the tree in place of the node to be deleted.

![Deleting node 5, a node with two
children](figures/binary-search-tree-delete-3.png)

The code to handle the third case is shown below. Notice
that we make use of the helper methods `find_successor` and `find_min` to
find the successor. To remove the successor, we make use of the method
`splice_out`. The reason we use `splice_out` is that it goes directly to
the node we want to splice out and makes the right changes. We could
call `delete` recursively, but then we would waste time re-searching for
the key node.

The code to find the successor is shown below and as you can see is a
method of the `TreeNode` class. This code makes use of the same
properties of binary search trees that cause an inorder traversal to
print out the nodes in the tree from smallest to largest. There are
three cases to consider when looking for the successor:

1.  If the node has a right child, then the successor is the smallest
    key in the right subtree.
2.  If the node has no right child and is the left child of its parent,
    then the parent is the successor.
3.  If the node is the right child of its parent, and itself has no
    right child, then the successor to this node is the successor of its
    parent, excluding this node.

The first condition is the only one that matters for us when deleting a
node from a binary search tree. However, the `find_successor` method has
other uses that we will explore in the exercises at the end of this
section.

The `find_min` method is called to find the minimum key in a subtree. You
should convince yourself that the minimum valued key in any binary
search tree is the leftmost child of the tree. Therefore the `find_min`
method simply follows the `left` references in each node of the
subtree until it reaches a node that does not have a left child.
