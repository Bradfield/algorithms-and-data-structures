title: Practical Algorithms and Data Structures

This book is a practical—and, we hope, entertaining—introduction to some
of the most important algorithms and data structures in computer
science.

We have written the examples in this book in idiomatic Python to help
convey the *usefulness* of these algorithms and data structures, both
directly and as models for analogous work that you will do.

Many software engineers are skeptical that this subject matter is
useful; our best explanation for such skepticism is that those engineers
never encountered these topics in a way that encouraged deep
understanding. Perhaps they were [unfortunate
enough](http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education) to participate in
a computer science program that encouraged rote memorization or
subjected themselves to such an experience for the sake of succeeding at
technical interviews. Or perhaps they became adequate programmers
without having encountered the content at all and presume that they
have reached the limits of their capabilities.

Whatever the case, we’re confident that the usefulness of algorithms and
data structures is proportional to the depth at which you understand it.
Those who study trees are more likely to identify tree shapes in their own
data, unlocking superior solutions to their problems. Those who see recursion
everywhere see recursion everywhere. Those who have big O analysis in their
toolkits not only have a better vocabulary for comparing alternative
strategies, they are also more generally cognizant of the trade-offs we
implicitly make every day.

One trade-off that *we* have made is to sacrifice breadth for the sake
of depth; we cover fewer algorithms and data structures than a typical
introductory text may cover in order to focus more on what we consider
to be important. For instance, we do not cover sorting algorithms,
a topic that rarely arises in practice, at all; instead, we spend more time
walking you through interesting applications of tree and graph traversal
algorithms. For this reason, we recommend that you work through the examples
slowly, with an open REPL or text editor, verifying that you are absorbing
the content so you can use these abstractions throughout your career.
